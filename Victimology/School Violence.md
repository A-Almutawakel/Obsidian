There are many factors that lead to various types of violence in schools, and the harmful effect it has on the youth should not be underestimated. The result of students victimised by school violence in the long-term could inhibit anxiety, depression, suicidal tendencies, substance abuse, anti-social behaviour, and even criminal activity.[1] Although there might not be one simple solution, we can create programs within schools to reduce violence, and create a safer environment for students.

The first suggestion I would make is to have the parents be more involved with their children’s education, both at home and school. Trying to establish a more open communication system between the school and parents, so that both sides can support the child with their school work, and overall skills and behaviour. According to Peterson and Skiba, “Increased parent involvement has been shown to result in increased student success, increased parent and teacher satisfaction, and improved school climate.”[2]

Next step is to emphasize on mental health for students and teachers. One Harvard study found that counselors have a great influence on students’ success within and outside of school.[3]  Having a dedicated counselor that is either a therapist or psychologist, and give every student and faculty member a monthly appointment, would be beneficial in the long-term. Students would learn to open up more, and have stronger foundations to combat emotional distress. It would also be healthy for faculty members to share their perspective, to have a better understanding of the daily interactions between teachers and students. 

My final suggestion is having a strong stance against any type of bullying in schools. In Canada, seven out of ten youth aged 15 to 17 have reported experiencing some type of bullying at schools.[4] Bullying exhibits many traits from verbal and physical actions, to social exclusion, and its effects can be severe on victims if left unattended. Creating a program to prevent bullying through stronger supervision, awareness, and heavy consequences could have a successful outcome in reducing bullying behaviour in schools.

School violence comes in many forms, and even though the solution is not straightforward, the most effective method is to tackle it by establishing various programs to equip students with necessary tools avoid being victimised. I have outlined three strategies that would go hand in hand and build a positive space for students.

Many factors lead to various types of violence in schools, impacting youth negatively. The result of students victimized by school violence in the long term could inhibit anxiety, depression, suicidal tendencies, substance abuse, anti-social behavior, and even criminal activity.[1] Although there might not be a simple solution, we can create programs within schools to reduce violence and create a safer environment for students.

According to Peterson and Skiba, “Increased parent involvement has been shown to result in increased student success, increased parent and teacher satisfaction, and improved school climate.”[2]

The next step is to emphasize mental health for students and teachers. One Harvard study found that counselors have a prolonged positive influence on student's success within and outside of school.[3]  Having a dedicated counselor providing every student and faculty member with a monthly appointment would be beneficial in the long term.

## Response #1

While I agree with your overall sentiment, I am against implementing extreme security measures like metal detectors. I understand the reasoning, but this only solves a symptom rather than the root cause. These measures could contribute to a perceived danger, creating a threatening atmosphere for students.[1] However, there still needs to be some protection in place for the safety of the students, but in a more discreet fashion.
