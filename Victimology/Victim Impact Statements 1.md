# Discussion #5

I firmly believe that victims have a right to express their side of the story, just as defendants do. The President's Task Force on Victims of Crime concluded that "a judge cannot reach an informed determination of the danger posed by a defendant without hearing from the person he has victimized." **[1]** The opportunity to share a voice through a Victim Impact Statement (VIS) is a right given to individuals who have endured the harms of criminal acts. Both sides make a compelling argument, but despite its imperfections, it is a necessary process to include the victims in the justice procedure.

We must first acknowledge the importance of using VIS in the criminal justice system; it should not just be the State against the criminal, but it should involve all parties affected by that crime. According to Paul G. Cassell, there are four main justifications for VIS. The first is to inform the court about the harm caused by the crime. Second, to help victims recover from the crimes committed against them. Third, they educate the defendant about the full consequences of the crime, perhaps leading to acceptance of responsibility and rehabilitation. And finally, it creates a perception of fairness at sentencing by ensuring that the court hears all parties involved.**[2]** 

By integrating the VIS, the criminal justice system recognizes the multi-faceted nature of crime and its repercussions, ensuring that the impact on victims is neither ignored nor minimized. This approach helps the justice system to be thorough and thoughtful, making sure it treats everyone involved with fairness and respect.

It is crucial to point out that the justice system must hold no biases when the sentencing occurs. In the journal "What Are Victim Impact Statements For?" Susan A. Bandes states, "Is it possible to convey the uniqueness of the victim with encouraging comparative judgments, and in particular, without introducing pernicious factors like race, ethnicity, gender, and social class into the sentencing calculus? I argue that it is not."**[3]** However, I believe the defendants are also subject to a comparable risk of prejudicial treatment. Is it possible to entirely remove these influences from legal proceedings?

Bandes would also question whether the articulateness of one victim who provides a powerful statement could have more impact on the sentencing compared to another victim of the same crime with a less affecting VIS.**[3]** Again, I argue the same applies to the articulateness of the accused and the impact their statement bears on their sentences. 

A strong argument that Bandes highlights is the claim of the healing nature that VIS offers, whether it addresses what the victims might need for their statement to help them heal, and the damaging aspects of promising the victims that their voice will directly affect the sentence.**[3]** Perhaps this could create more suffering for the victim if they feel their statement was not good enough, leading to disappointment and neglect by the justice system. 

Recognizing these challenges, it becomes imperative that we continually strive to refine our legal practices, ensuring that VIS serves its intended purpose of healing and justice without inadvertently introducing bias or inequality into sentencing decisions. 

In conclusion, the evolution of the criminal justice system over the past four decades has significantly amplified the voices of victims, allowing them to convey the extent of their suffering. My exploration of the arguments surrounding VIS has highlighted their influential role in court proceedings. In the past five years, the Office of the Federal Ombudsman for Victims of Crime (OFOVC) has made significant progress in advocating for victims' rights in Canada. Notably, in 2020, they established the first-ever Indigenous Advisory Circle and Academic Advisory Circle to ensure their work is evidence-based.**[4]** 

Furthermore, restorative justice has emerged as a complementary path, seeking to mend the harm by facilitating a dialogue between victims and offenders. One of the recommendations of the OFOVC to the federal government is to "Amend the Canadian Victims Bill of Rights to ensure that all officials in the criminal justice system are mandated to provide information on restorative justice programs to victims who report crimes. Provide sustainable core funding for community-based restorative justice programs."**[5]** So, despite the drawbacks of VIS, its importance to victims' rights is undeniable. The current trend of legal and social reforms suggests that victims' rights will continue to grow stronger.

### Response #1

While it's true the importance of including victim impact statements during the court procedure, but a significant problem is the lack of awareness among many victims about their right to submit one An older study from 2006 found that 42% of judges found it difficult to know if victims were informed of their right to submit a VIS.[1] 

The root of this problem stems from the Victim Bill of Rights, which states that victims must actively "ask for information" about the justice system, the available services, and the progress of their case, including the status of the person who harmed them.[2] This wording puts the burden on the victim to seek out information about their case and their rights.

However, the Office of the Federal Ombudsman for Victims of Crime has recommended that the federal government amend sections 6, 7, and 8 of the Bill of Rights, changing the language from "Every victim has the right, on request, to information about…" to "Every victim shall automatically be provided with information about…"[3] Such an amendment would ensure that all victims are proactively given information about their case and their rights, including how to submit a VIS, without having to request it.

S. A. Bandes: Distinction between victims with and without VIS. [p. 1265]

One concern I would add about VIS is how judges handle cases where some victims provide a statement to those where they do not, even when the crimes are identical. Susan A. Bandes, a known critic of VIS, speculates whether the absence of a victim's statement should result in a lighter sentence for a defendant. She raises the fundamental question of by what metric judges measure the emotional damage that these statements aim to articulate.[1]  Given the emotional aspects of VIS, the boundary between informing the court and influencing sentencing can often become unclear. While I understand the reasoning behind giving the discretion to victims to submit a VIS, it does raise a concern whether this could complicate fair sentencing decisions.

### Response #3

You make a compelling point. However, I would like to reconsider the idea that VIS may result in unnecessary delays. While some argue that VIS leads to delays and inappropriately influences judicial decisions, it is crucial to note that the defendants and victims deserve an equal opportunity to express their perspectives. The President's Task Force on Victims of Crime highlighted that "defendants speak and are spoken for often at great length before sentence is imposed. It is outrageous that the system should contend it is too busy to hear from the victim."**[1]** Indicating that justice is required from both parties to have the same opportunity to share their narratives.

~~To address the concerns of influencing the judges, the Task Force countered, pointing out that judges need information from both sides to be equitable. Since prosecutors lack personal insight into the crime’s effects on victims, their representation may not fully convey the victim's suffering.**[1]**

To expand on your point of judges omitting parts of the VIS, a frequently mentioned problem is the victim's false expectation about the influence of their statements on the outcome of sentencing. If deemed irrelevant, it could worsen the victim's trauma. Echoing this sentiment through the lens of the Brock Turner case**[2]**, Susan A. Bandes suggests that victims may feel neglected and undervalued if the sentencing does not align with their expectations of justice, as was the case for Chanel Miller.**[3]** Leading to a sense of being unheard and a lack of respect from the system.
