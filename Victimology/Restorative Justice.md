# Discussion #6 Draft

In the context of this case, the immediate response that comes to mind is that yes, of course the judge should sentence the two offenders differently. Restorative Justice (RJ) and Criminal Justice (CJ) have contrasting measures when it comes to sentencing the offender. However, I realized that it also creates a paradox; the main goal of our judicial system is to be impartial, and consistent when delivering the sentence. Is it fair that one criminal would be sentenced to community service, while the other sentenced to prison even though he committed the same crime? This creates a weird legal precedent, leading the offender to feel that the justice system has failed them. Does that mean that  RJ or CJ are flawed concepts?

According to Howard Zehr, there is no consensus regarding the definition of RJ, even among scholars whose primary field of research is restorative justice.[1] For the sake of this essay, I will be using the definition that the United Nations’ Office on Drugs and Crime, which states: “Restorative justice is an approach that offers offenders, victims and the community an alternative pathway to justice”.[2] The purpose of RJ is to empower the victim, offender, and the communities affected by their interaction through participation. The affected parties should all contribute to the process of restoring harmony following an offense.[3] Through RJ, all parties come together and have a dialogue between them, and arrive at a mutual understanding of what happened, and reach to an agreement on the outcome.

CJ on the other hand, is a form of retributive justice that focuses on the wrongdoing, and is determined through the court between accused and the state.[4] Kathleen Day states: “In established CJ processes, research shows that in the courtroom, a defendant
is typically mute and a victim is not present. State actors do all the work of handling
and processing crime.”[5] CJ removes the victim out of the equation, and handles offenses through punitive measures.

There is a lot of evidence on the success RJ, a great example is in the case of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa 1996, authorised by Nelson Mandela and chaired by Desmond Tutu, that led to the transformation and healing of the South Africans’ transition from apartheid, to a just, multiracial society.[6] This details the impact that RJ has, and an undeniable fact that it is a form of justice that can have success.

Back to the case study, the divergence in sentencing raises legal and ethical questions. It challenges the principles of fairness and consistency in the legal system. The influence of victim choice on sentencing outcomes further complicates the debate, questioning whether justice should be individualized or standardized. And, although differential sentencing aligns with the restorative justice goal of tailored, rehabilitative outcomes, it risks creating inconsistencies in sentencing, potentially undermining public trust in the justice system and setting controversial precedents.

As a result, my stance on this matter is somewhat conflicted, the victim’s wishes should be respected by the judge, but not by foregoing impartiality. As it stands at the moment, RJ can not be dealt in absolutes, but rather within the confines of the court and the justice system. That is not to say that legal precedent can not be overturned, and in the example of this case, if the first offender was sentenced to community service, then the second victim could get a conditional sentence such as house arrest if deemed just by the court.

# Discussion #6 Post

Considering the dilemma of sentencing offenders differently based on Restorative Justice (RJ) participation, there is a conflict between RJ's empowerment focus and Criminal Justice's (CJ) retributive nature. While Howard Zehr notes the absence of a universal RJ definition,**[1]** the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime describes it as: "an approach that offers offenders, victims, and the community an alternative pathway to justice."**[2]** This collaborative approach contrasts with CJ's focus on state-led punitive action, often excluding victims. As detailed by Kathleen Day, “In established CJ processes, research shows that in the courtroom, a defendant is typically mute and a victim is not present. State actors do all the work of handling and processing crime.”**[3]**

The success of RJ in transformative healing is evident in cases like South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, endorsed by _Nelson Mandela_ and chaired by _Desmond Tutu_ in transitioning from apartheid to a just, multiracial society.**[4]** This historical example underscores RJ's potential in societal healing and justice transformation.

However, the polarity sentencing raises legal and ethical questions. It challenges the principles of fairness and consistency in the legal system. The influence of victim choice on sentencing outcomes further complicates the debate, questioning whether justice should be individualized or standardized. And, although differential sentencing aligns with the restorative justice goal of tailored, rehabilitative outcomes, it risks creating inconsistencies in sentencing, potentially undermining public trust in the justice system and setting controversial precedents.**[5]**

My stance on this is nuanced. While believing a judge should respect victims' wishes in RJ, it should not forego the need for impartiality and legal consistency. Perhaps the solution lies in flexible sentencing within judicial boundaries. For instance, if an offender participating in RJ is sentenced to community service, a similar case might warrant a conditional sentence like house arrest, maintaining fairness yet acknowledging the RJ process.

## Response #1

Hey Kiishi,

I have concerns with different sentencing in this scenario, as it could lead to inconsistent legal precedents. Restorative Justice (RJ) stands on the opposite side of our current justice system.[1] With RJ, it seeks to restore harmony to those harmed, and the current system seeks to punish the offender directly, often sidelining the impacted parties. In its present state, I believe the coexistence of RJ and the traditional justice system seems challenging if we are to uphold impartiality and consistency in sentencing.

## Response #2

Hey Gillian,

My view generally aligns with yours. It is difficult to justify two offenders sentenced differently, especially for a severe crime. While the victim's wishes are important, the sentence is at the judge’s discretion, based on what is deemed appropriate for each case. Additionally, the essence of RJ is to maintain equal concern for all stakeholders; any approach favoring only the victim and offender at the community's expense is morally unacceptable.[1] As per the United Nations Handbook on Restorative Justice, for RJ to effectively integrate with traditional justice systems in sentencing decisions, it is crucial to evaluate how participants in RJ compare to those in the standard justice system.[2] This approach is vital to RJ's growth and harmonious coexistence with existing legal frameworks.

#### Key Points to Consider
- There is not a one determined definition that is agreed upon.
	- The United Nations’ (UN) Office on Drugs and Crime offers a much more encompassing definition in its publication “Hand book on Restorative Justice Programmes”: “Restorative justice is an approach to problem solving that, in its various forms, involves the victim, the offender, their social networks, justice agencies and thecommunity.”7 [United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Handbook on Restorative Justice Programmes, Criminal Justice Handbook Series (New York: United Nations, 2006), 6.]

- **Main points of Restorative Justice:**
	1. The idea that people can be empowered through the participation.
	2. Victims, offenders, and the community affected by their interactions should all contribute to the process of restoring harmony following an offense.

## Inquiry with the Professor

Hello Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss some points of confusion regarding our latest discussion on Restorative Justice (RJ).

Initially, RJ seemed to be a beneficial system to integrate into our current justice system. However, the scenario from the recent discussion raised some doubts. It appears that RJ might disproportionately empower victims in determining offenders' punishments. This observation is especially relevant when victims choose not to engage in RJ and instead seek traditional punitive justice.

I've reviewed several articles and studies but couldn't find any addressing how RJ might lead to different sentencing for two offenders, influenced by the victims' decisions. Does that mean that precedent is less significant in RJ sentencing?

I'm finding it challenging to understand how RJ and traditional justice systems can coexist, given their contrasting approaches. Am I overlooking a crucial aspect of RJ's integration with the criminal justice system?

While I recognize RJ's benefits, such as its success with youth offenders and its role in South Africa's post-apartheid era, I question the practicality of RJ replacing traditional justice, as its approach is idealistic and fails to consider the limitations of what it aspires to achieve. As Kathleen Day remarks, "We should expect modest results, not the nirvana story of RJ" (Daly, 2005) [http://www.antoniocasella.eu/restorative/Daly_2005.pdf].

I have already contributed to the discussion, but I'm very interested to hear your perspective and thought process on how you would approach this complex topic.
