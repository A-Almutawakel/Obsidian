# Establishment of Apartheid

## Origins & Ideology

- **Apartheid** is an Afrikaans word meaning *apartness* or *separateness*, which was a system of institutionalized racial segregation that existed in South Africa from 1948 to the early 1990s.
	- The purpose of **apartheid** was to ensure that South Africa was *dominated* politically, socially, and economically by the nation’s dominant *minority white* population akin to white supremacy. 
	- In this system, there was a hierarchy of race status, where *White* citizens had the highest status, followed by  *Indians* and *Coloureds*, then *Black Africans*. This hierarchy was legally enforced and deeply institutionalized, affecting every aspect of life from housing to education and employment.

- In 1948, South Africa's **general elections** marked a pivotal change in the nation's trajectory.
	- The _United Party_, led by the incumbent Prime Minister Jan Smuts, narrowly lost, securing just under half of the total votes. They were defeated by the _Herenigde Nasionale Party_ (HNP), under the leadership of D. F. Malan, a cleric from the Dutch Reformed Church.
	- Electoral laws pertaining to [[History#Franchise (1850s-1900s)|Franchise]] sharply limited voting rights for people of colored and Asian descent; African voters were entirely excluded since the late 1930s, except for a select few who met stringent criteria and voted for designated white MPs.
	- The election results were influenced by a combination of factors, including Afrikaner nationalism and white voters' discontent with post-World War II domestic and economic challenges in South Africa.
	- The HNP's slim victory led to the consolidation of Afrikaner political forces, culminating in the formation of the National Party. This event marked the beginning of a 46-year era of apartheid rule in South Africa.

## Apartheid & Segregation Laws

- When the National Party came to power in 1948, there were factional differences in the party about the implementation of systematic racial segregation. The *baasskap* (meaning “boss-hood” or “boss-ship”) faction, which was the dominant faction within the NP, favoured the use of controlling black African labor to further advance the economic gains of Afrikaners.

- The state passed laws that paved the way for *grand apartheid*, which was centered on separating races on a large scale, by compelling people to live in separate places defined by race.
	- A strategy adopted from the British rule after they took control of the *Boer republics* in the [[History#First and Second Anglo-Boer War (1880-1902) | Anglo-Boer war]].
	- The minister of native affairs of the NP government in 1950, *Hendrik Verwoerd* had a significant role in crafting these laws, which led him to be regarded as the *Architect of Apartheid*.

### Racial Classification and Residential Segregation
- The first *grand apartheid* law was the **Population Registration Act of 1950**, which formalized racial classification and the introduction of identity cards for anyone over the age of 18, specifying their racial group.
	- There was confusion about distinguishing between some races, especially *Coloured* people, which led to the creation of official boards to reach a conclusion to identify their race. Causing the *separation* of family members that were allocated different races.

- The second pillar of *grand apartheid* was the **Group Areas Act of 1950**, this act put an end to diverse areas and determined where one lives according to race. Creating *black-only locations*, where blacks were *forcefully* relocated to their own towns away from whites.

- The **Prevention of Illegal Squatting Act of 1951** allowed the government to *demolish black shanty town slums* and forced white employers to pay for the construction of housing for those black workers who were permitted to reside in cities otherwise reserved for whites.
---
### Regulating Social and Marital Relations
- The **Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act of 1949** *prohibited* marriage between persons of different races.

-  **Immorality Act of 1950** made sexual relations between whites and other races a *criminal offense*.
---
### Public Life and Suppressing Dissent
- Under the **Reservation of Separate Amenities Act of 1953** municipal grounds could be *reserved for a particular race*, creating segregated beaches, buses, hospitals, schools, etc. 
	- The services provided to Black South Africans were greatly *inferior* to those of whites, and, to a lesser extent, to those of Indian and Coloured people.

- The **Suppression of Communism Act of 1950** aimed to suppress resistance towards the government, and specifically apartheid, banned the *Communism Party of South Africa* and any party subscribing to *Communism*.  
	- After the **Defiance Campaign against Unjust Laws** that was presented by the[[Neslon Mandela#ANC | ANC]], the government used the act for mass arrests and banning of leaders of dissent groups.
	-  Other acts such as **Customs and Excise Act 1955** and the **Official Secrets Act 1956** or established to censor films, literature, and media, following the release of the Freedom Charter, where 156 leaders of the dissent were charged in the **1956 Treason Trial.**
		- The same year, the **Native Administration Act of 1956** allowed the government to banish blacks. It deprived them of the right to appeal to the courts by means of an interdict or any legal process against forced removals.

### Educational and Economic Policies in Bantustans
- The **Bantu Authorities Act of 1951** Established separate government structures for black and white populations, laying the foundation for separate development in the *Bantustans*. This act was integral to implementing the policy of geographical and political segregation.

-  **Bantu Education Act, of 1953** created a segregated education system for black South Africans. It emphasized African culture and vocational training, administered under the Ministry of Native Affairs. This act significantly defunded mission schools that had previously provided more comprehensive education to black students.

-  **Bantu Investment Corporation Act of 1959** established a mechanism to channel capital into the homelands to foster employment opportunities there. This act aimed to develop the economies of the homelands independently from the white-dominated areas of South Africa.

- **Legislation of 1967** enabled the government to restrict industrial development in 'white' cities and redirect it to the homelands. This was part of a broader strategy to make homelands economically viable and further segregate the population.

- **Sports and Interracial Contact**, while there were no explicit laws segregating sports, interracial contact in sports was strongly discouraged, reflecting the broader societal norms of apartheid.
---
### Citizenship and Autonomy in Homelands
- **Promotion of the Black Self-Government Act of 1959**: enshrined the National Party's policy of creating nominally independent homelands for black people. It proposed self-governing Bantu units with administrative powers and the promise of future autonomy. This act also abolished white representatives for black South Africans and removed the few remaining black voters from the electoral rolls.

- **Black Homeland Citizenship Act of 1970** initiated a new phase in the Bantustan strategy by changing the status of black South Africans to citizens of one of the ten autonomous territories. The goal was a demographic majority of white people within South Africa by pushing for the independence of all Bantustans.
---
### Controlling Movement: The Pass Laws
- The **Native Laws Amendment Act of 1952** centralized and tightened pass laws so that blacks could not stay in urban areas longer than *72 hours without a permit*.

- The evolution of **Pass Laws** was tightened, compelling black South Africans to carry *identity documents* to regulate their movement and employment. Blacks needed these documents to live and work in cities. Initially, women were largely exempt, but later efforts to extend pass laws to women met with significant resistance until they were more broadly applied in 1956.
