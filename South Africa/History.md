# Colonization (1652-1902) 
## Arrival of Jan Van Riebeeck (1652)

- The Dutch East India Company established a trading post in *Cape of Good Hope* under the command of **Jan Van Riebeeck** in 1652.
	- People who were brought to farm the lands came from the Netherlands. They were joined later by Huguenot refugees, German people, and English-speaking people as well. 
	- Those various nationalities married across and gave birth to the people were referred to as *Afrikaners* or *Boers*.

## Invasion of the Cape Colony (1795-1820)

* The **British** first occupied the Cape Colony in 1795, during the [Napoleonic Wars.](<[Napoleonic Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars "Napoleonic Wars")>) 
	* The [Peace of Amiens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Amiens "Peace of Amiens") in 1802 temporarily restored the colony to the Dutch (under *Batavian* *Republic* rule).

* After the Napoleonic Wars in 1806, a second British invasion reoccupied the Cape Colony after the [Battle of Blaauwberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Blaauwberg "Battle of Blaauwberg") and it remained under the British colony until the[[#Union of South Africa (1909-1961) | Union of South Africa]] in 1910.
  
* The British rule brought significant changes in terms of administrative, legal, and social systems, which led to tensions with the Dutch settlers (Boers).
	* One of the first tasks of Great Britain was the *outlaw* of using the Dutch language and convert the European settlers to the British language and culture.
	* In 1807 Britain *abolished* the trading of slaves.
	* In 1820 Britain brought out *4,000 settlers* who were known as the 1820 settlers.

## Great Trek (1830s)

* The **Voortrekkers** (the Boers who participated in the organized migrations of systematic colonization), who were not happy with what happened in the Cape, approached the authorities intending to move into the *interior* of South Africa that Britain had no use for.
	* They were assured that they could go beyond the *Orange River* and beyond the *Vaal River*, they would be free to govern themselves.

* After crossing the rivers in 1852, the *Orange Free State* became a republic. In 1854, the *Transvaal* became a republic (South African Republic). 
	* In 1839, *Natalia* was a short-lived republic established by the Boers, emigrating from the Cape Colony. After continuous attacks by the British forces, the Boers accepted British annexation in 1844 and became *the Colony of Natal*. Those who refused to acknowledge British rule trekked to settle in the *Orange Free State* and *Transvaal* republic.

* The **discovery** of gold in February 1886 at a farm called Langlaagte on the *Witwatersrand* of the Transvaal in particular precipitated a gold rush by prospectors and fortune seekers from all over the world.
	* The gold discovery was called [Witwatersrand Gold Rush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witwatersrand_Gold_Rush "Witwatersrand Gold Rush"), which resulted in the production of a quarter of the world’s gold. In turn, the “instant city” of Johannesburg rose on the back of the Witwatersrand gold reef.

## Disenfranchisement (1850s-1900s)

- In mid-19th century, South Africa, the Disenfranchisement for non-whites and foreigners was shaped by the diverse colonial policies of the time.
  >  **Franchise** in this context refers to the right to vote in public elections which revolve around who was allowed to vote and under what conditions, with a particular focus on the distinctions made based on race and, in some cases, property or income.

- **Cape Colony (Under British Rule)**
	- The Cape Colony were more liberal with their approach towards franchise policy compared to other regions. 
	- A qualified franchise system was in place, allowing men of all races to vote if they met certain property and income criteria. 
	- Despite this seemingly inclusive policy, in practice, these criteria were structured in a way that favored the white population, making it difficult for most non-whites to qualify for voting.

- **Natal, Transvaal, and Orange Free State**
	- In Natal, a British colony, and the Boer Republics of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State, the franchise was generally restricted to white males.
	- These regions had a clear policy of excluding non-whites from political participation and maintaining a racially segregated society.

- **Rights of Foreigners**
	- The discovery of diamonds and gold in South Africa in the mid-19th century attracted a significant number of foreign nationals. Their rights varied; while they were crucial for the economic boom, they often faced discrimination and were seen as outsiders in the societal and political landscape.
	- In the Transvaal Republic, President *Paul Kruger* saw all these foreigners coming to mine as a threat to his governance. The tension between the Boer government and foreign miners ('*Uitlanders*') was significant, as the latter were denied voting rights and other civic privileges. 
	- Kruger's policies reflected a protective stance towards Boer interests, prioritizing the preservation of their political control and cultural identity in the face of a rapidly changing demographic landscape."

## First and Second Anglo-Boer War (1880-1902)

* The **First Anglo-Boer** war began in 1880, following the forceful *annexation* of the Transvaal Boer Republic By Britain in 1877. The long-standing resentment of the Boers towards Britain led to a full-blown rebellion. The conflict ended as soon as it began with a decisive Boer victory at [Battle of Majuba Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Majuba_Hill "Battle of Majuba Hill") (27 February 1881).

* Continuous tension between Britain and the Boers peaked in 1899 when the British demanded voting rights for the 60,000 whites on the Witwatersrand. 
	* President *Paul Kruger* rejected the British demand and called for the withdrawal of British troops from the borders of the South African Republic.
	* After the British refused, the **Second Anglo-Boer** (aka South African War) lasted longer than the first and did not end until 1902.
	  >**Note**: Both *Mahatma Gandhi* and *Winston Churchill* participated during the second war against the Boers.

* By 1902, the war had claimed the lives of 22,000 imperial soldiers and 7,000 republican fighters.

* On May 31st, 1902, the signing of the peace treaty known [Treaty of Vereeniging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Vereeniging "Treaty of Vereeniging"), the Boer republics acknowledged British sovereignty, while the British in turn committed themselves to the reconstruction of the areas under their control.

# Union of South Africa (1909-1961)

## South Africa Act (1909)

- After the Treaty of Vereeniging, the **South Africa Act 1909** was an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that created the Union of South Africa (historical predecessor to the present-day *Republic of South Africa*). The Act was commenced on May 31st, 1910,  with the unification of Cape, Natal, Transvaal, and Orange River colonies. Including the former territories that were formerly part of the South African Republic, and the Orange Free State.
	- Just like Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, the Union of South Africa was a self-governing dominion of the British Empire.
	- It’s full sovereignty was confirmed with the [[#Balfour Declaration of 1926]] and the Statute of Westminster 1931.

- With the formation of the Union of South Africa in 1910, the political rights of black Africans were further *restricted*. The new Union's government adopted policies that effectively excluded the vast majority of black Africans from the electoral process.

- For most of the Union's existence, the South Africa Act provided for each Province to have equal *representation* in the upper house, the Senate, and Senators were chosen by an electoral college made up of the Province's members in the House of Assembly and the members of the provincial legislature.

- The **Natives** **Land Act of 1913** further disenfranchised black South Africans by severely restricting the areas of land they could own, which in turn impacted their ability to meet property-based qualifications for voting.

- The Act established *English* and *Dutch* as the official language of South Africa, with equal status under the law, and required all government documents and Parliamentary proceedings to be published in both languages. However, the meaning of Dutch was changed by the Official Languages of the Union Act, 1925 to include both Dutch and Afrikaans.

- Disagreement over where the Union’s capital should be, a compromise was in which every province would be dealt a share of benefits of the capital.
	- The *Administrative* capital would be in **Pretoria** (Transvaal).
	- **Cape Town** as the seat of Parliament, is the *Legislative* capital (Cape Province).
	- The *Judicial* capital would be in **Bloemfontein** (Orange Free State).

## The Creation of the Republic of South Africa (1961-Present)

- Although most English-speaking whites in South Africa favored close relations with the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth, the Afrikaans-speaking *National Party* held anti-British sentiments and was opposed to South Africa’s intervention in World War II.
	- Some Afrikaans Nationalist organizations, like the *Ossewabrandwag*, were openly supportive of Nazi Germany during the war.

- Most English-speaking South Africans were opposed to the creation of a republic, many of them voting “no” in the 5 October referendum. However, due to the larger number of Afrikaans-speaking voters, the referendum was *narrowly* passed, leading to the establishment of a republic in 1961. 
	- The government led by the National Party consequently withdrew South Africa from the Commonwealth.

- Later on, the National Party government passed a Constitution that repealed the [[#South Africa Act (1909)]]. 
	- This decision together with the South African Government’s insistence on adhering to its policy of [[apartheid]] resulted in South Africa’s de facto expulsion from the Commonwealth of Nations.
